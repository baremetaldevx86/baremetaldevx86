# Vedant Chauhan

Systems programmer focused on low-level software, performance, and correctness.

## Interests
- Operating systems, kernels, and drivers
- Compilers, runtimes, and memory allocators
- Systems ML: autograd engines, runtimes, and memory management
- Networking and distributed systems
- Quantitative finance systems and Algorithmic Trading

## Top Projects
- **Autograd Engine in C** — Reverse-mode automatic differentiation with dynamic computation graphs and manual memory management.
- **Browser Engine in Rust** — HTML/CSS parsing, layout, and rendering with strong safety and performance guarantees.
- **Custom Memory Allocator + Shell** — User-space allocator with a minimal shell to test, profile, and reason about memory behavior.

## Core Skills
- C, C++, Rust, Python
- Linux internals, POSIX, syscalls
- Memory management, concurrency, IPC
- Bare-metal and embedded development
- Performance profiling and optimization

## Tools
- Linux, GDB, strace, perf
- Neovim, Make, CMake
- Git, Bash

## Long-Term Direction
- Systems and GPU engineering
- Building subsystems from scratch to understand internals
- Linux kernel modules and driver-level experiments
