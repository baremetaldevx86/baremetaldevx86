# AnyOne

Systems-first engineer focused on building correct, performant software from first principles. Interested in low-level systems, ML infrastructure, and quantitative engineering.

---

## Current Focus

* Deep neural networks from scratch (autograd engines, training loops, numerical stability)
* Systems programming in C/C++ and Rust-like mental models
* ML infrastructure and performance (memory, kernels, data movement)
* Quantitative thinking: statistics, probability, optimization

---

## Selected Projects

* **Autograd Engine (C)** – A from-scratch automatic differentiation engine with tensor ops, backprop, and custom memory handling.
* **Memory Allocator** – Custom allocator exploring arenas, freelists, and fragmentation tradeoffs.
* **Shell & Web Server** – UNIX-style shell and a minimal HTTP server to understand process control, I/O, and networking internals.

---

## Technical Strengths

* Low-level programming: memory, pointers, caches, undefined behavior
* Mathematical foundations: linear algebra, calculus, probability
* Systems debugging: tracing, profiling, reasoning about performance
* Linux-first development environment

---

## Languages

* C
* C++
* Python
* Rust
* Bash

---

## Learning Philosophy

* Read the paper
* Read the code
* Re-implement both

---

## Direction

Aiming toward roles involving Systems engineering, ML infrastructure, GPU Engineering and Quantitative research. Long-term goal: work on high-performance systems where math meets silicon.
