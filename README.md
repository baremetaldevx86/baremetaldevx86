## Current Project - [microDR](https://github.com/baremetaldevx86/microDR) (Backpropagation, but through light)

---
## Current Focus

* Deep neural networks from scratch (autograd engines, differentiable renderers, training loops, numerical stability)
* Systems programming in C/C++ and Rust-like mental models
* ML infrastructure and performance (memory, kernels, data movement)
* Quantitative thinking: statistics, probability, optimization

---

## Selected Projects

* **Autograd Engine (C)** – A from-scratch automatic differentiation engine with tensor ops, backprop, and custom memory handling.
* **Memory Allocator** – Custom allocator exploring arenas, freelists, and fragmentation tradeoffs.
* **Shell & Web Server** – UNIX-style shell and a minimal HTTP server to understand process control, I/O, and networking internals.

## Technical Skills

* Low-level systems programming: manual memory management, pointer-level reasoning, cache hierarchies, branch prediction, undefined behavior, and performance-critical C/C++ with a strong mental model of modern CPUs
* ML systems: end-to-end ML infrastructure - custom autograd engines, differentiable renderers, numerical kernels, training loops, performance profiling, and low-level optimization for ML workloads
* Mathematical foundations: linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability, and statistics with direct application to optimization, learning dynamics, and numerical methods
* Systems debugging & performance engineering: tracing, profiling, flame graphs, bottleneck analysis, memory/layout optimization, and root-cause investigation on Linux
* Linux-first engineering: toolchains, build systems, shell, debuggers, system introspection, and working close to the OS and hardware

---

## Languages

* C
* C++
* Python
* Rust
* Bash

---

## Learning Philosophy

* Read the paper
* Read the code
* Re-implement both

---

## Direction

Aiming toward roles involving Systems engineering, ML infrastructure, GPU Engineering and Quantitative research. Long-term goal: work on high-performance systems where math meets silicon.
